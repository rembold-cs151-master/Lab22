# Lab 22

The goal in lab today is to get some more practice defining simple classes, and to see how to define special functions to them them a more natural interaction wth many Python build-in symbols.

I went ahead and wrote autotests for this lab, so you should be able to get some simple feedback about if everything is working properly. If for whatever reason it starts taking you over an hour to get through this, please pause and contact me so we can try to get you sorted out and back on track. No sense banging your head against a wall when I can probably help out and get you back on track!
